== Welcome to Py Webkit Html Manipulator ==
This script allows you to render a webpage on your server and manipulate and 
extract the rendered html. The manipulation is done with
javascript in the browser using the pyQt Webkit Api.

The difference from a normal html scraper is that javscript and css also is 
rendered.

== Installation ==
Install python and pyQt. On ubuntu you would run:

  sudo apt-get install python python-qt4

If you make it work on other platforms please let me know how.

== Usage ==
# Get help
  ./whm.py --help

# Run it
  ./whm.py -u 'http://example.com'

# Run it headless. Works only on linux. You need to install xvfb first.
# On ubuntu run sudo apt-get install xvfb 
  xvfb-run --server-args="-screen 0, 640x480x24" ./whm.py --url='http://example.com' --js-file=whm-example.js

== The format of the js file ==
If no --js-file argument is supplied the html for webpage will be outputted.
If --js-file argument is present the output will be the content of
the variable WebkitHtmlManipulator.result that must be available in the global
scope.

See whm-example.js for an example. It adds information about position,
font-size, etc. to each element in the dom.
